# Installation of vim-airline fonts

## Patched Fonts

The following [github](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
repo has several patched fonts that will work with powerline-symbols. Simply
clone into to repo and run `./install.sh`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
fonts/.install.sh
```

This will install the fonts to `$HOME/.fonts` and can now be used in both
terminal and gui versions of vim.
